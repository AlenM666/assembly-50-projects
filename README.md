Welcome to the **assembly-x86_64** repository! This collection of projects is designed to help you learn and explore x86_64 assembly programming on Linux. Each project focuses on different aspects of system-level programming, providing practical examples and exercises.

## üìÅ Projects Overview

- **TCP_echo_Server**: A simple TCP echo server that listens for incoming connections and echoes back any received messages.
- **ini_file_parser**: Parses `.ini` configuration files, demonstrating string manipulation and file parsing techniques.
- **read_file**: Reads and displays the contents of a file, showcasing basic file I/O operations.
- **register_login_service**: Implements a basic user registration and login system, highlighting user input handling and data storage.
- **save_to_file**: Demonstrates writing data to a file, emphasizing file creation and write operations.
- raylib: Using raylib with assembly-x86_64, basic stuff.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Assembler**: [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) installed on your system.
- **C Compiler**: [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for linking, if necessary.
- **Operating System**: Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Arch).

### Building a Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlenM666/assembly-x86_64.git
   cd assembly-x86_64


<br>

2.  Run and build projects

    ```
    #to run and compile run this in project dir.
    ./run.sh

    #or some projects later have Makefile
    #in project dir: 
    make 

    ```
